# Project Title
DegenStore - ERC-20 Token with In-Game Item Redemption

# Description
DegenStore is a Solidity smart contract that implements an ERC-20 token named "Degen" with the symbol "DGN." This contract also integrates the Ownable contract from the OpenZeppelin library, providing ownership control. The primary purpose of this project is to create a simple token system with additional features for minting, transferring, burning, and redeeming tokens for various in-game items. The in-game items and their associated token prices are defined using an enumeration type named RedeemType.

# Getting Started
1. Open the Remix IDE at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
2. Create a new file or use the existing one.
3. Copy and paste the contents of MyToken.sol into the file.

5. Deploy the smart contract using the Remix "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.


# Interacting with the Degen
